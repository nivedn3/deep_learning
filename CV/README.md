# Gesture Digit Recgnition
-This was a project done to recognize numbers which were drawn on the Air.I used a kinect as a depth camera to increase the accuracy for detecting the hand properly.The code wont work unless a kinect is connected to your computer.But you can check the neural network for detecting numbers by compiling and running the 'code.cpp' .It predicts the number saved as 'test.jpg'.You can also manually draw a number by using paint.py.
